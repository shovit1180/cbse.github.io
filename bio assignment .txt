Biology ASSIGNMENT
Forest fires- during burning processes nitrogen level rises.
Charcoal deposited during fire events converts ammonia to nitrates.This is an important part of
nitrogen cycle.

Lightning-during this process nitrogen combines with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide which
combines with moisture of atmosphere to form nitrates.Thus adding up in nitrogen cycle.
